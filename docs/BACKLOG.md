## üîÆ Post-Production Features

### #9 - ML Decision Dashboard for AI Choice Visibility
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks

**Description:**
Create a comprehensive dashboard that provides visibility into AI decision-making processes, showing how the system selects documents, weighs relevance, and generates responses.

**Features:**
- Document selection rationale visualization
- Relevance scoring heat maps
- Confidence metrics per response
- Performance tracking over time
- Decision tree diagrams
- Token usage analytics

**Dependencies:**
- ML infrastructure must be stable
- Analytics data collection in place
- User feedback system operational

**Business Value:**
- Increases user trust in AI recommendations
- Helps identify areas for model improvement
- Provides transparency for compliance/audit purposes
- Enables data-driven optimization

**Technical Notes:**
- Requires logging infrastructure for AI decisions
- May need significant backend data aggregation
- Consider privacy implications of decision logging

### #18 - External Document Integration (SharePoint)
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks

**Description:**
Integration with external document management systems, primarily Microsoft SharePoint, to enable seamless access to documents stored outside the nxtProposal system.

**Features:**
- SharePoint API authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- Document search and retrieval
- Link management for external documents
- Bi-directional sync capabilities
- Permission and access control mapping
- Automatic metadata extraction

**Dependencies:**
- SharePoint API access and credentials
- Secure credential storage system
- Network/firewall configuration for API access
- Understanding of customer SharePoint structures

**Business Value:**
- Eliminates need for duplicate document storage
- Reduces manual document copying
- Keeps source of truth in existing systems
- Enterprise-ready integration

**Technical Notes:**
- Requires Microsoft Graph API implementation
- OAuth2 flow for user authentication
- Consider rate limiting and API quotas
- May need webhook support for real-time updates

**Security Considerations:**
- Store credentials securely (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Implement proper access control mapping
- Audit trail for external document access
- Handle token refresh automatically

**Phases:**
1. **Phase 1:** Read-only SharePoint document access
2. **Phase 2:** Link management and metadata sync
3. **Phase 3:** Bi-directional sync (optional)
4. **Phase 4:** Other systems (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box)

## üìã Items Moved to Backlog

These items were previously on the active todo list but have been deprioritized based on current project needs:

### Related to Active Features
- Advanced ML Dashboard (complement to existing AI features)
- External integrations (once core system is production-stable)

---

## üîÑ Review Schedule

This backlog should be reviewed:
- **Quarterly:** During sprint planning sessions
- **Post-Production:** After core features are deployed and stable
- **On-Demand:** When customer requests align with backlog items
- **Annual:** Strategic planning and roadmap updates

---

## üìä Prioritization Criteria

Items move from backlog to active development based on:

1. **Customer Demand** - Multiple customer requests or high-value customer request
2. **Strategic Value** - Alignment with long-term product vision
3. **Resource Availability** - Team capacity and expertise available
4. **Technical Readiness** - Dependencies resolved and infrastructure ready
5. **ROI** - Clear business value relative to implementation cost

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

For items graduating from backlog to active:
- Clear acceptance criteria defined
- Technical design document created
- Resource allocation confirmed
- Timeline and milestones established
- Success metrics identified

---

## üìù Notes

- Items in backlog are NOT deleted - they represent valuable future enhancements
- Customers may request backlog items - evaluate on case-by-case basis
- Some backlog items may become obsolete as technology evolves - review annually
- New items can be added to backlog at any time via product team
