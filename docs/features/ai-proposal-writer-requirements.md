# AI Proposal Writer - Feature Requirements

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** AI-Driven Proposal Generation
**Added:** 2025-09-30

## Overview

An AI-powered proposal writing system that learns organizational proposal style and assists in creating complete, high-quality government proposals from outline through final draft.

## Business Requirements

### Problem Statement
Government proposal writing is:
- Time-intensive and requires significant human resources
- Dependent on institutional knowledge of "our style"
- Difficult to maintain consistency across large teams
- Requires coordination of multiple subject matter experts (blue team)
- Often rushed due to tight solicitation deadlines

### Solution Vision
An AI model that:
1. **Learns** from past successful proposals to understand organizational writing style
2. **Creates** structured outlines based on solicitation requirements
3. **Manages** blue team bullet contributions from subject matter experts
4. **Generates** full proposal drafts that maintain style consistency
5. **Iterates** based on feedback to improve quality

## Core Features

- Learn organization-specific terminology and acronyms
- Build style guide from successful vs. unsuccessful proposals

**Data Sources:**
- Past performance documents from PP RAG system
- Winning proposals from document repository
- Compliance frameworks and templates
- Organization style guides and branding documents

**Training Metrics:**
- Proposal win rate correlation with style adherence

### 3. Blue Team Bullet Management System

**Description:** Coordinate input from subject matter experts (blue team) who provide bullet points that the AI expands into full prose.

**Workflow:**
1. **Assignment:** Proposal manager assigns sections to blue team members
2. **Contribution:** SMEs provide bullet points for their assigned sections
3. **Review:** Proposal manager reviews/approves bullets
4. **Expansion:** AI expands bullets into full paragraphs/sections
5. **Iteration:** SMEs review expanded content, refine bullets if needed

**Blue Team Interface:**
- Section assignment notifications
- Bullet point submission form with guidance
- Real-time collaboration (multiple SMEs per section)
- Bullet status tracking (draft, submitted, approved, expanded)
- Comments and feedback threads

**Bullet Metadata:**
- Section reference (which outline section)
- Contributor name and expertise area
- Key points to emphasize
- Supporting data/references
- Compliance requirements addressed
- Graphics/figures needed

**Example Bullet Submission:**
```
Section: 3.2 Implementation Approach - Phase 1

- **Track Changes:** Integration with Word track changes
- **Regeneration:** Re-run AI generation with refined bullets or guidance
- **A/B Testing:** Generate multiple versions, choose best
- **Learning:** Feed accepted changes back into style training

**Review Workflow:**
```
Draft Generated â†’ Review â†’ Feedback â†’ Regenerate â†’ Review â†’ Approve
                    â†“                      â†‘
                  Reject              Refine Bullets
```

**Quality Metrics:**
