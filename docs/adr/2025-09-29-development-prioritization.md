# ADR: Development Priority Strategy

**ADR Number**: 2025-09-29-001
**Title**: Development Prioritization Strategy for Q4 2025
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Author**: Senior Software Engineer

## Context

The nxtProposal system has reached production readiness for core features (Epics 1, 3, 4, 5 complete) but requires both immediate fixes and strategic enhancements. We need to balance quick wins that improve user experience against long-term architectural improvements.

### Current State
- **Completed**: Infrastructure, Solicitation Analysis, AI Writing, Compliance Management
- **Issues**: UI bugs, 2-minute model warm-up delay, incomplete admin features
- **Opportunities**: Past Performance RAG, chat history, ML transparency

### Stakeholder Needs
- **Immediate**: Fix frustrating UI issues and performance problems
- **Short-term**: Complete partial features and enhance AI capabilities
- **Long-term**: Build differentiating features like RAG and visualizations

## Decision

We will implement a **phased priority approach** that balances immediate fixes with strategic development:

### Priority Framework
1. **P1 - Critical Fixes** (Week 1): Issues blocking productive use
2. **P2 - Core Functionality** (Weeks 2-3): Complete partial features
3. **P3 - Advanced Features** (Weeks 4-6): Enhanced user experience
4. **P4 - Epic Features** (Weeks 7-12): Major new capabilities
5. **P5 - Integration Features** (Weeks 13-16): Enterprise readiness

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **User Impact**: How many users affected and severity
2. **Technical Debt**: Fixes that prevent future issues
3. **Feature Completeness**: Finishing what we started
4. **Strategic Value**: Differentiation and competitive advantage
5. **Implementation Risk**: Technical complexity and dependencies

## Rationale

### Why This Order

**Quick Wins First (P1)**
- Builds user confidence
- Low effort, high impact
- Removes daily friction
- Shows responsiveness to feedback

**Complete Before Expanding (P2)**
- Reduces technical debt
- Provides stable foundation
- Enables proper testing
- Maintains system coherence

**Intelligence Before Scale (P3-P4)**
- AI transparency builds trust
- Chat history enables productivity
- RAG provides differentiation
- Visualizations improve usability

**Integration Last (P5)**
- Requires stable core
- Complex external dependencies
- Lower initial user impact
- Can be customer-specific

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option 1: Epic 2 First**
- **Pros**: Major feature differentiation
- **Cons**: Ignores current pain points
- **Decision**: Rejected - user satisfaction critical

**Option 2: All Fixes First**
- **Pros**: Perfect stability
- **Cons**: Delays innovation
- **Decision**: Rejected - need balance

**Option 3: Parallel Development**
- **Pros**: Faster overall delivery
- **Cons**: Resource constraints, quality risks
- **Decision**: Rejected - single user/developer focus

## Consequences

### Positive
- Immediate user satisfaction improvements
- Systematic technical debt reduction
- Clear roadmap for stakeholders
- Measurable progress milestones
- Flexibility to adjust priorities

### Negative
- Epic 2 delayed by 6-7 weeks
- Some advanced features wait
- Sequential dependencies
- Limited parallelization

### Mitigation
- Prepare Epic 2 design during P1-P2
- Use feature flags for partial releases
- Automate testing for faster cycles
- Document progress transparently

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: P1 Quick Wins
- Fix edit button functionality
- Remove console logging
- Optimize model warm-up

### Weeks 2-3: P2 Core Features
- Complete document type management
- Implement global prompts
- Full project CRUD

### Weeks 4-6: P3 Advanced
- Chat history system
- ML decision dashboard
- Configuration management

### Weeks 7-12: P4 Epics
- Epic 2 RAG implementation
- Visualization features
- Classification systems

### Weeks 13-16: P5 Integration
- Compliance deep-dive
- RBAC implementation
- External integrations

## Metrics

### Success Indicators
- **Week 1**: Zero console logs, <30s warm-up
- **Week 3**: 100% CRUD coverage
- **Week 6**: Chat history active
- **Week 12**: RAG search <3s
- **Week 16**: Full RBAC active

### Tracking
- Daily progress updates
- Weekly metric reviews
- Phase completion gates
- User satisfaction surveys

## Review Schedule

- **Week 1**: Validate P1 completion
- **Week 3**: Review P2, adjust P3
- **Week 6**: Major milestone review
- **Week 12**: Epic 2 assessment
- **Week 16**: Full implementation review
