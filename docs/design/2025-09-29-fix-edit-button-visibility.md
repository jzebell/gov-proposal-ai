# Fix Edit Button Visibility Issue - Implementation Documentation

**Document**: Edit Button Role-Based Visibility Fix
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Completed
**Author**: Senior Software Engineer

## Problem Statement

The Edit button on project cards was visible to all users regardless of their role, when it should only be visible to administrators.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug
In `Layout.js`, the `isAdmin` prop was being passed to ProjectCard incorrectly:
```javascript
// INCORRECT - passing function reference
isAdmin={isAdmin}
```

### Why This Happened
1. In `AuthContext.js`, `isAdmin` is defined as a **function**: `const isAdmin = () => { ... }`
2. In `Layout.js`, it was being passed as a prop without calling the function
3. Since functions are truthy values in JavaScript, the condition `{isAdmin && onEdit && (` always evaluated to true
4. This made the Edit button visible to all users

## Solution Implemented

### The Fix
Changed the prop passing to call the function:
```javascript
// CORRECT - calling the function
isAdmin={isAdmin()}
```

**Location**: `E:\dev\gov-proposal-ai\frontend\src\components\Layout.js:1447`

## Technical Details

### Component Chain
1. **AuthContext** provides `isAdmin` as a function
2. **Layout** consumes `isAdmin` from useAuth hook
3. **Layout** passes the result to ProjectCard component
4. **ProjectCard** uses `isAdmin` prop for conditional rendering

### Role Check Logic
```javascript
// AuthContext.js
const isAdmin = () => {
  return user && (user.role === 'admin' || user.roleName === 'admin');
};

// ProjectCard.js
{isAdmin && onEdit && (
  <button>✏️ Edit</button>
)}
```

## Testing the Fix

### How to Test Role-Based Access

1. **Login as Admin**:
   - Email: any@email.com
   - Role: Select "Administrator" from dropdown
   - Result: Edit button should be visible on project cards

2. **Login as Non-Admin**:
   - Email: any@email.com
   - Role: Select "Writer" or any other role
   - Result: Edit button should NOT be visible on project cards

### Available Roles in Development
- Administrator (admin) - HAS edit access
- Proposal Lead - NO edit access
- Solutions Architect - NO edit access
- Writer - NO edit access
- Business Development - NO edit access
- Reviewer - NO edit access
- Subject Matter Expert - NO edit access

## Additional Context

### Correct Pattern Usage
The menu filtering was already correct:
```javascript
const menuItems = allMenuItems.filter(item => !item.adminOnly || isAdmin());
```

### Common Pitfall
When passing functions from hooks as props:
- If you need the **result**: call it `prop={func()}`
- If you need the **function itself**: pass it `prop={func}`

## Impact

### Before Fix
- All users could see and click the Edit button
- Security risk: non-admins could potentially edit projects
- Confusing UX: users without permissions saw unavailable actions

### After Fix
- Only administrators see the Edit button
- Proper role-based access control
- Cleaner UI for non-admin users

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Edit button hidden for non-admin users
- [x] Edit button visible for admin users
- [x] Admin menu items properly filtered
- [x] Archive button follows same pattern (admin-only)
- [x] No JavaScript errors in console

## Related Components

- `AuthContext.js` - Defines role checking functions
- `Layout.js` - Main container passing role information
- `ProjectCard.js` - Consumes role for conditional rendering
- `AdminSettings.js` - Admin-only component (properly gated)

---

**Result**: Successfully fixed the Edit button visibility issue by properly calling the `isAdmin()` function when passing it as a prop.
