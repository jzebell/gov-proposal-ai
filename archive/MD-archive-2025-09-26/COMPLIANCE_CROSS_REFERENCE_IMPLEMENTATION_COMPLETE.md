## ðŸ”¬ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Semantic Matching Algorithm**

#### **Phase 1: Direct Semantic Matching**
Uses AI to analyze requirement text and identify relationships:
```javascript
// Example relationships detected:
// REQ-001 -> REQ-045 | impacts_cost | high | Encryption processing requires additional compute capacity
// REQ-001 -> REQ-078 | requires_expertise | medium | Requires cybersecurity specialist with encryption experience
```

#### **Phase 2: Pattern-Based Detection**
Pattern matching using predefined relationship patterns:
```javascript
relationshipTypes: {
  'impacts_cost': {
    patterns: ['hardware', 'software', 'licensing', 'infrastructure', 'personnel'],
    weight: 0.9
  },
  'requires_expertise': {
    patterns: ['security clearance', 'certification', 'specialized', 'expert'],
    weight: 0.8
  }
}
```

#### **Phase 3: Impact Chain Analysis**
Analyzes predefined impact chains for cascading relationships:
```javascript
impactChains: {
  'security_chain': [
    { category: 'security', impacts: ['technical', 'cost', 'staffing'] },
    { category: 'technical', impacts: ['performance', 'cost'] }
  ]
}
```

#### **Phase 4: AI-Powered Complex Relationships**
Uses AI for high-priority requirements to detect complex interdependencies:
- Cascading costs across multiple areas
- Skill dependencies between requirements
- Timing dependencies
- Risk multipliers
- Integration challenges

### **Relationship Data Structure**
```javascript
{
  sourceRequirement: 'REQ-001',
  targetRequirement: 'REQ-045',
  relationshipType: 'impacts_cost',
  confidence: 0.85,
  description: 'Security requirement drives infrastructure costs',
  detectionMethod: 'semantic_ai',
  sourceCategory: 'security',
  targetCategory: 'infrastructure'
}
```

### **Cross-Reference Analysis Output**
```javascript
{
  totalRequirements: 25,
  crossReferences: [...], // All detected relationships
  relationshipStats: {
    totalRelationships: 47,
    byType: { impacts_cost: 12, requires_expertise: 8 },
    byConfidence: { high: 15, medium: 22, low: 10 },
    averageConfidence: 0.67
  },
  impactAnalysis: {
    highImpactRequirements: [...], // Requirements with most outgoing relationships
    costImpactChains: [...],       // Cost-related relationship chains
    riskAmplification: [...]       // Risk amplifying relationships
  }
}
```
