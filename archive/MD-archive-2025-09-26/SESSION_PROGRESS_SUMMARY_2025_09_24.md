# Session Progress Summary - September 24, 2025

## Session Overview
**Focus**: Document Reading Fixes + Document Context Feeding Planning
**Duration**: Extended session covering multiple technical challenges
**Status**: Document reading ‚úÖ Complete, Context feeding üìã Planned & Documented

---

## Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Document Reading System Fixed
**Problem**: Only PDFs were working in the document reading pane, DOCX and TXT files showed "not implemented" errors.

**Root Cause**:
- DocumentManagerService lacked text extraction methods for DOCX/TXT formats
- Docker build context issues prevented updated code from deploying
- Route conflicts and database lookup issues

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced DocumentManagerService**:
   - Added `extractDocumentText()` method supporting PDF, DOCX, TXT, DOC
   - Added `extractPdfText()` using pdf-parse library
   - Added `extractDocxText()` using mammoth library
   - Added `getDocumentContent()` method with database lookup

2. **Fixed Route Implementation**:
   - Removed duplicate content routes causing conflicts
   - Updated remaining route to use DocumentManagerService properly
   - Fixed database document lookup by original filename

3. **Resolved Docker Issues**:
   - Identified that backend was built image, not volume-mounted source
   - Implemented proper rebuild cycle for code changes
   - Verified all document formats now work correctly

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ PDF documents: Working (maintained existing functionality)
- ‚úÖ DOCX documents: Now extracting text content properly
- ‚úÖ TXT documents: Reading plain text correctly
- ‚úÖ DOC documents: Basic support with conversion recommendation

### üìã Document Context Feeding System Planned

**Comprehensive Requirements Gathering**:
- Conducted detailed Q&A session covering UX, technical, and admin requirements
- Defined RAG implementation strategy (strict mode vs augmented mode)
- Planned chunking strategy (logical sections + semantic classification)
- Designed admin configuration system for priority rules

**Key Design Decisions**:
- All active documents auto-included in context
- Project-specific context with caching
- 70/20/10 token allocation (context/generation/safety)
- Background context building with 10-second delay
- Comprehensive admin settings for tweaking behavior

**Documentation Created**:
- Complete technical specification document
- Database schema changes planned
- Implementation phases defined
- Success criteria established

## Technical Details Resolved

### Document Processing Pipeline
```
Document Upload ‚Üí File Storage ‚Üí Database Entry ‚Üí Context Invalidation ‚Üí
Background Context Rebuild (10s delay) ‚Üí Cached Context Available
```

### Priority System Architecture
```
Active Status > Document Type Hierarchy > Metadata Matching >
Recency > File Size Considerations
```

### RAG Implementation Strategy
- **No Hallucinations Mode**: Document-only responses with citations
- **Augmented Mode**: Document-informed creative writing
- **Admin Configurable**: Strictness slider and model-specific settings

---

## Code Changes Made

### Backend Service Updates
**File**: `backend/src/services/DocumentManagerService.js`
- Added pdf-parse and mammoth imports
- Implemented comprehensive text extraction methods
- Added database-aware document content retrieval
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**File**: `backend/src/routes/documents.js`
- Removed duplicate/conflicting content routes
- Updated remaining route to use DocumentManagerService
- Fixed JSON response structure
- Improved error handling

### Database Schema Ready
- Identified need for `project_contexts` table for caching
- Planned metadata enhancements for project and document records
- Designed context invalidation triggers

---

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- All document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, DOC) readable in pane
- Proper text extraction from all supported formats
- Database-backed document lookup and retrieval
- Error handling for unsupported formats
- Docker build/deployment process understood and working

### üèóÔ∏è Ready for Implementation
- Document Context Feeding System (fully spec'd and documented)
- Admin configuration interface
- Context caching infrastructure
- Citation and hyperlinking system

### üìã Next Session Priorities
1. Implement core context caching system
2. Build document processing pipeline
3. Create context size display UI
4. Add admin configuration settings
5. Test RAG modes with real documents

---

## Challenges Overcome

### Docker Development Workflow
**Challenge**: Code changes not reflecting in running containers
**Solution**: Understanding that backend uses built images, not volume mounts
**Learning**: Always rebuild backend image after significant code changes

### Route Conflicts in Express
**Challenge**: Multiple routes with similar patterns causing conflicts
**Solution**: Route ordering awareness and duplicate route removal
**Learning**: Express processes routes in registration order

### Database-File Mapping
**Challenge**: Documents stored with timestamped filenames but referenced by original names
**Solution**: Database lookup first, then file system access using stored paths
**Learning**: Always use database as source of truth for file locations

## Files Modified This Session

### Source Code
- `backend/src/services/DocumentManagerService.js` - Enhanced text extraction
- `backend/src/routes/documents.js` - Fixed content route

### Documentation
- `MD/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT_FEEDING_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete technical spec
- `MD/SESSION_PROGRESS_SUMMARY_2025_09_24.md` - This summary document

### Docker
- Rebuilt backend image multiple times to deploy changes
- Verified container file system vs local file system mapping

---

## Key Learnings

### System Architecture
- Document processing pipeline needs robust error handling
- Caching strategies critical for performance at scale
- Admin configurability essential for fine-tuning AI behavior

### Development Process
- Comprehensive requirements gathering prevents mid-implementation changes
- Documentation-first approach clarifies complex system interactions
- Docker development requires careful attention to volume vs build contexts

### AI Integration
- RAG systems need both strict and creative modes
- Context size management crucial for various model capabilities
- Citation systems balance functionality with development complexity (80/20 rule)

**Session Conclusion**: Successfully resolved document reading issues and created comprehensive plan for document context feeding implementation. Ready to begin Phase 1 development in next session.

**Estimated Next Session Duration**: 2-3 hours for core context system implementation
**Prerequisites for Next Session**: Review specification document and confirm any final requirements
