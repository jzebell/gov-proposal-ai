# Development Instructions - Document Context Feeding Implementation

## Instructions for Implementation

### For Each Task Completed:

#### 1. **Document Progress Immediately**
- Update `DOCUMENT_CONTEXT_FEEDING_SPECIFICATION.md` with:
  - Mark completed items with ✅ in implementation phases
  - Add "Implementation Details" sections for completed features
  - Note any deviations from original plan with rationale
  - Update status from "Ready for Implementation" to "In Progress" to "Complete"

#### 2. **Update Session Progress**
- Create or update session progress file: `SESSION_PROGRESS_CONTEXT_FEEDING_[DATE].md`
- Document each completed task with:
  - What was implemented
  - Files modified
  - Code changes made
  - Testing results
  - Any issues encountered and solutions

#### 3. **Maintain Project Documentation**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with feature additions
- Update `README.md` if new user-facing features added
- Update database schema documentation if DB changes made
- Update API documentation for new endpoints

#### 4. **Track Dependencies & Integration**
- Note any changes to existing systems
- Document breaking changes or compatibility issues
- Update configuration requirements
- Note any new dependencies added

#### 5. **Testing Documentation**
- Record test cases executed
- Document expected vs actual behavior
- Note any edge cases discovered
- Record performance metrics where relevant

## Continuous Documentation Requirements

### During Implementation:
1. **Code Comments**: Add clear comments for complex logic
2. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages following project standards
3. **Progress Updates**: Update todo lists and status markers in real-time
4. **Issue Tracking**: Document any blockers or unexpected challenges immediately

### After Each Session:
1. **Update Master Specification**: Reflect actual implementation vs planned
2. **Create Session Summary**: Record what was accomplished and what's next
3. **Update Project Status**: Overall project completion percentage and next priorities
4. **Backup Documentation**: Ensure all documentation changes are committed

### Before Ending Implementation:
1. **Final Testing**: Comprehensive test of all implemented features
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation is current and accurate
3. **Deployment Notes**: Record any deployment or configuration steps needed
4. **Handoff Preparation**: Create clear summary of current state for next session

## Success Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics:
- Context building time for various project sizes
- Memory usage during context operations
- API response times with context enabled
- Database query performance for context retrieval

### Functional Metrics:
- Number of documents successfully processed
- Context size ranges achieved
- Error rates for different document types
- User experience responsiveness

### Quality Metrics:
- Citation accuracy and usefulness
- RAG mode effectiveness
- Context relevance to generated content
- Admin setting effectiveness

## File Organization Standards

### Documentation Files:
- `MD/DOCUMENT_CONTEXT_FEEDING_SPECIFICATION.md` - Master specification (keep updated)
- `MD/SESSION_PROGRESS_CONTEXT_FEEDING_[DATE].md` - Session-specific progress
- `MD/CONTEXT_FEEDING_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md` - Technical implementation notes
- `MD/CONTEXT_FEEDING_TESTING_RESULTS.md` - Test results and benchmarks

### Code Files:
- Follow existing project structure
- Add clear module/class headers
- Include inline documentation for public methods
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Database Files:
- `backend/migrations/` - Database schema changes
- `backend/src/models/` - New model files
- Document all schema changes in migration files
