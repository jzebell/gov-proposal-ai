#### Response Format
```
Q: "What are the security requirements?"

A: The solicitation requires FedRAMP High authorization and FISMA compliance.
Specifically:

• FedRAMP High Authorization required within 6 months (Section 3.2.1, p. 15)
• Annual security assessments per NIST 800-53 (Section 3.2.3, p. 16)
• FIPS 140-2 Level 3 encryption for data at rest (Amendment 001, p. 3)

Source Documents: Base RFP Section 3.2, Amendment 001
